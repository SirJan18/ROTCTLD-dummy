# ROTCTLD-dummy
This is my first attempt at this. It is also my first QT project so its going to be a little rough.
But once compiled simple press the ok button and you have a tcp server bound to port `5733`. 
It complies with the absolute very minimum `p` and `P AA.AAAA EE.EEEE` commands and that's about it.

I'm going to be rewriting this pretty much from scratch again and see if I can improve anything.
